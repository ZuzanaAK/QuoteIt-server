# About QuoteIt - React App
 
QuoteIt is a simple fully-responsive React app, built with mobile-first approach in mind, that allows users to store their favorite quotes and share them with others. An external quotes API was implemented to show random quotes for every time when page is refreshed.

## Structure

QuoteIt has two repositories here on Github, the client-side and the server-side. The client-side is deployed on Netlify and the server-side on Heroku. 

## Technologies used

I didn't used any external css library in this project. QuoteIt design was created purely by using CSS preprocessor Sass.

In the client-side: React, HTML-JSX, CSS, Javascript, Sass

In the server-side: Express.js, MongoDB, Nodemailer


## How to run the project

Use `npm start` to run the client-side.
Use `npm run dev`to run the server-side.
